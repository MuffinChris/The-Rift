THE RIFT NOTES / TODO

- Need to cancel default attack particles (high damage)
- Portals to go around in town, and to go back to spawn as opposed to direct TP without class magic
- Advanced Food System
- Improved inventory system? Item drops directly into inventory perhaps?
- Remember to check old notes
- classes that consume items for power and or ability usage etc. maybe even alot
- Horses ramp in speed
- Separate Dev Environment Server. Support with File System etc.
- Discover new enemies ??? => Named
- For unarmed class make one slot always deny item


- IMPORTANT: Use the PacketWrapper GitHub to decipher packets
- IMPORTANT: Every status should be in a StatusObject or the like.
For example invuln, just give a set amount of iframes instead of set true and set false after cast
